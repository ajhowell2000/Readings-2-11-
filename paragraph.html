<p> In the video, I learned that software engineers have to use soft skills too and not only technical skills. People in this field should be able to be creative, logical, while also being able to communicate well with others very well. These skills allow for software engineers or others in this field to be more dynamic than someone that just codes. Technical skills can be easier to learn rather than soft skills that take time to actually develop well. It seems that people hold software engineers accountable to a certain standard. These standards are actually stereotypes that prove to be false within the career.
</p>
<p>We can see that these stereotypes can be broken by looking at other jobs and classes that teach these skills. Our syllabus requires us to help our classmates that are struggling. People within the real world are working in teams. These teams review each othersâ€™ code and give suggestions to make them better than they are. Teams make the process easier because then more ideas are incorporated within a project rather than work alone.</p>
<p>Another connection that is present between the two would be the idea of mistakes being okay. Mistakes are going to be made and that is okay. The learning process can be hard but it is meant to assist in helping students or workers to grasps new content. Even in the corporate world, people are being taught about coding and are learning new concepts. These people along with us are prone to make mistakes.</p> 
<p> Effort plays a large portion within this type of work and that seems to be one of the most important ideas that Mayuko provides for us within the video. If someone is putting in effort outside the classroom or work environment then the results should be a lot more positive.</p>
